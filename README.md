As per wiki,

> Bresenham's line algorithm is a line drawing algorithm that determines the points of an n-dimensional 
raster that should be selected in order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two points. 
It is commonly used to draw line primitives in a bitmap image (e.g. on a computer screen), as it uses only integer addition, 
subtraction and bit shifting, all of which are very cheap operations in standard computer architectures. 
It is an incremental error algorithm. It is one of the earliest algorithms developed in the field of computer graphics. 
An extension to the original algorithm may be used for drawing circles.

This repository contains the implementation of Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm using Javascript.
